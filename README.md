Overview of The project:

Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is one of the main growing fields in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
ATS is exponentially growing nowadays because of the vast amount of data, textual data, that raises on a daily basis on the internet. Summarizing a text manually is a costly process in terms of time, cost
and effort. Therefore, ATS is considered one of the essential fields in ML and NLP. 
ATS automatically generates a summary (and reduces the size) of any text.
There are two main approaches in ATS, extractive and abstractive.
To the best of our knowledge, There are minimal attempts that use a recent ATS approach to deal with the Arabic language.
In this project, we aim at utilizing a state-of-the-art abstractive approach to build an Arabic ATS.

The dataset that we used in our project:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fadyelkbeer/arabic-summarization-bbc-news?select=bbc_news_arabic_summarization.csv

In order to enhance the model to understand the Arabic semantics, 
we opted to use the well-known AraVec3.0 1 which is a pre-trained word embedding model that will make the model understand the meaning of Arabic sentences.
